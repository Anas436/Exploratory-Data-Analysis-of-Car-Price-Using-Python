# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Car-Price-Using-Python



In this NoteBooks I have shown Exploratory Data Analysis using various techniques to find out proper impact of Car price. Also I have used different statistical operations base on this question __"What are the main characteristics that have the most impact on the car price?"__


<h3>Important Variables</h3>

<p>We now have a better idea of what our data looks like and which variables are important to take into account when predicting the car price. We have narrowed it down to the following variables:</p>

Continuous numerical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Curb-weight</li>
    <li>Engine-size</li>
    <li>Horsepower</li>
    <li>City-mpg</li>
    <li>Highway-mpg</li>
    <li>Wheel-base</li>
    <li>Bore</li>
</ul>

Categorical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Drive-wheels</li>
</ul>

<p>As we now move into building machine learning models to automate our analysis, feeding the model with variables that meaningfully affect our target variable will improve our model's prediction performance.</p>
